Assignments(due on Wednesday, 5th August)
1. Consuming an API (Open Banking) (30%)
After you have seen what was done for the Barclays banking platform, make calls to 2 APIs
locally ( after creating a mock server) without using the example APIs taught in class.
For example, the ‘Card Details’ and ‘Check balance’ examples are 2 separate APIs.
You can get the API files of a bank developer portal to accomplish this. Some examples include
DBS Developer portal, Standard Chartered aXess (https://axess.sc.com), NAB Developer portal,
Barclays Developer Portal.
Per function:
● Review the institution’s API documentation
○ Describe on what functions will you be using, and from which platform. Marks will
be based on clarity of description.
● Mock the API hosted via Postman
● Test the API
● (BONUS) Call the mock API from Javascript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Executing a Payments related API (40%)
In this task, you are to execute an API that has a payment-related function. Some examples of
this include sending/receiving transactions, merchant queries on account balances, payment
status enquiries. Any process that has to do with moving money around is considered payments
related in the context of this question.
Here, an institution here can refer to a bank, insurance provider, robo advisor, payments
gateway or even stockbrokers or financial institutions.
Example: Stripe/ VISA/ Mastercard/Paypal/ Banks on open banking platforms
Same as the function above, make a call to an API locally ( after creating a mock server) without
using the example APIs taught in class.
Per function:
● Review the institution’s API documentation
○ Describe on what functions will you be using, and from which platform. Marks will
be based on clarity of description.
● Mock the API hosted via Postman
● Test the API
● (BONUS) Call the mock API from Javascript

3. Designing an API (30%)
Suggest an API that could be built to expose a service. This could be a new or existing service,
data, or combination of several services.
Describe why an organisation would want to publish the API, including how they would achieve
a return on their investment (e.g. pay-per-use, transaction fee, or reward a customer loyalty, or
gather data to provide customer insights).
Answer these questions:
● Who are the consumers of the API?
● What value would the service provide to the consumer of the API?
● Who are the end users of the client app that would consume the API?
● What additional value would the API consumer provide to their end user?
● How would your API create value for the company from the service lifecycle
perspective?
● What information would be passed in the API request/response?
